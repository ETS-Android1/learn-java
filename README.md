# learn-java
An android application that teaches Java programming.

About the curriculum:
- Courses, separated into chapters.
- An exam for each course (random questions from a question pool). Unlocks the next course.
- Tasks: example projects that you can solve (with solutions).

Features:
- Multiple application themes (dark and orange).
- Formatted code samples that are copiable and zoomable.
- Interactive code samples with missing parts (mini-tasks).
- Clip sync with your computer (bluetooth or local network).
- Notifications: get alerted when you can take a failed exam again.

Clip syncing uses my small app that can be downloaded from [here](https://gtomika.github.io/learn-java-clipsync/).
Launch it on your computer and select a syncing mode!
