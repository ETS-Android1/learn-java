# Learn Java android application
An android application that teaches Java programming.

It is already published in the playstore, see it [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gaspar.learnjava) 
for screenshots and download.

## Build process

You can import this project to Android Studio, but note that you'll only be able to build the **noads** 
build variant. The other two variants (**release**, **debug**) require files/sensitive information that 
are only present on my computer.

## Java teaching materials

About the curriculum:
- Courses, separated into chapters.
- An exam for each course (random questions from a question pool). Unlocks the next course.
- Tasks: example projects that you can solve (with solutions).

## Application features

Features:
- Multiple application themes (dark and orange).
- Formatted code samples that are copiable and zoomable.
- Interactive code samples with missing parts (mini-tasks).
- Clip sync with your computer (bluetooth or local network).
- Notifications: get alerted when you can take a failed exam again.
- Playground: edit and run simple Java programs (powered by [Glot.io](https://glot.io/).

## Built in clipsync

Clip syncing uses my small app that can be downloaded from [here](https://gtomika.github.io/learn-java-clipsync/).
Launch it on your computer and select a syncing mode!

## Code samples formatter

Code samples in the application have been formatted programmtically to display the way they do 
in the app. This is done by my [formatter tool](https://github.com/Gtomika/learn-java-code-formatter).
