        Before you can do anything, you need to install Java's development version. Here is how you can do it:

        <li>Select the download for your operating system.</li>

    <boxed title="JAVA_HOME environmental variable">
        <![CDATA[
        Your IDE will look for Java based on the value of <i>JAVA_HOME</i>. If you are familiar with environmental variables, then simply
        set <i>JAVA_HOME</i> to the <i>bin</i> folder of your JDK install directory. If you need a full tutorial, follow
        <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Set-Java-Home">this</a> wikiHow link.

        Everything is ready to install an IDE now! In this case, I'll use Eclipse IDE, but feel free to use
        another IDE, if you have other preferences.

    <title text="Install Eclipse"/>
    <text>
        <![CDATA[
        Navigate to the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">official Eclipse download page</a> on your computer, then select the correct
        download for your operating system. Then unpack and run the installer! Installing other IDE's is a very similar process.

        <![CDATA[
        Java is a set of specifications for a <b>software platform</b>. It's purpose it to allow programmers to create a wide
        range of applications for a <b>cross-platform</b> environment. In this chapter and the next one
        we will take a look at what these terms mean, and how does the Java platform provides all this.

    <boxed title="Not just a programming language">
        Notice that the Java platform is more then just a programming language, however it does contain
        a language, the one which shares a name with the platform, Java. Several other languages such as
        Kotlin or Groovy also use the Java platform!
    </boxed>

        <![CDATA[
        The platform was created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling">James Gosling</a>
         at Sun Microsystems, and now it's owned by the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation">Oracle Corporation</a>.

        <ul>
        <li>The Java programming language</li>

        <li>The Java Virtual Machine (JVM): executes the compiled bytecode, runs Java programs</li>
        <li>Class libraries: A large set of pre-written and compiled code, which can be used by any Java application.</li>

    <text>
        <![CDATA[
        Notice that so far we only talked about a list of specifications for a software platform, and not
        an actual implementation! These specifications are public, and so anyone can create their own version of the
        platform, provided that they follow the rules of the specifications.

        But since creating this takes an immense amount of work, Oracle also provides their implementation,
        called the <b>Java Development Kit (JDK)</b>. This is the most widely used implementation, but others
        also exist, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJDK">OpenJDK</a>. What you have just installed as
        "Java" was actually this, the JDK.

    <title text="Cross platform and the WORA principle"/>
    <text>
        <![CDATA[
        Java uses the <b>Write once, Run anywhere (WORA)</b> principle. This means that the programmer only
        needs to write and compile the source code once, after that, the compiled <b>bytecode</b> can
        be run with the Java Virtual Machine on any platform, such as Windows or Linux.

        <ol>
        <li>1. - The source code is given to the compiler.</li>
        <li>2. - The compiler checks if the code is valid, and if it is, compiles it into <b>bytecode</b>.</li>
        <li>3. - The <b>bytecode</b> is given to the Java Virtual Machine, which executes it.</li>

        Our IDE provides a <i>run</i> button for us, which will do this process for all our source
        files in the project. This way we don't have to call the <b>javac</b> and <b>java</b> commands
        from the command line.

        Finally, lets take a look at the the programming language of the platform, Java. It is one of the
        most widely used language as of this day.

        The two most important properties of Java are that it's <b>general-purpose</b> and it's <b>object-oriented</b>.
        It's not hard to guess what general-purpose means in this context. Indeed, it means that Java can be and is used
        for a wide range of tasks:
