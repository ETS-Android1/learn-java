        These are simple text files, marked with the <b>.java</b> extension, so that it's clear that
        they aren't just any text files, but java source files. Their content is is easily readable.

    <boxed title="Naming rules">
        <![CDATA[
        A java source file can't just have any name. Such a file can contain at most one <b>public class</b>
        and the filename must be the same as this class' name. As for what a public class is, it will be
        covered in a later chapter, but for now take a look at the image above.
        <br><br>
        You can see that the file contains <b>public class Main</b> part, and in the top left corner
        the filename can be seen, which is indeed <b>Main.java</b>.
        <br><br>
        We don't really have to give too much thought to this rule, as our IDE will always enforce it
        for us.

        These files contain compiled Java source code, also called <b>bytecode</b>. Unlike .java files,
        these aren't text files, but binary ones, and they can be given to the Java Virtual Machine
        for execution. Notepad++ can still open these files, but the result is far from readable:

        Our IDE will handle the compilation and execution of all our source files, but by default
        they are done from the command line, by using the <b>javac</b> and the </b>java</b> commands.

        JAR files also provide a way to start a Java application easily, without the command line. To make
        a JAR executable all we need to do is add the <b>fully qualified name</b> of the main class to the manifest, like so:

        Packages are a way to structure our Java projects. Imagine an application with dozens of source
        files, all in the same folder. Instead, the recommended way is to organize the <b>classes</b> by function.
        Packages can not only contain source files, but also other packages as well!

        Here is an example project with two packages and two classes (you can think of the class like it's
        the same as the source file, for now):

    <boxed title="Naming conventions">
        <![CDATA[
        Package names should contain only lower case letters.
        <br><br>
        The top level package is usually some domain name, like <b>com</> or <b>org</b>,
        then the next package is often the name of the organization, the programmer, or the project itself.
        After that, the packages are named by the functionality of the <b>classes</b> inside them.
        <br><br>
        If you examine the above image you can see that it adheres to these conventions.

        <![CDATA[
        <u>Important:</u> Some package names are restricted for packages in the Java language. These names are <b>java</b>
        and <b>javax</b>. Avoid naming a package any of these words, or the compiler will refuse to compile
        your source files.

    <advanced title="More then just structure">
        Packages provide much more then just structuring the project. They can hide classes inside them,
        or allow the programmer to have multiple classes with the same name, in different packages.

        The first statement of every <i>.java</i> file must be the <b>package declaration</b>.
        For example, if our source file (<i>Main.java</i>) is inside package <i>learnjava</i>, and this package is inside
        package <i>com</i>, then the the first statement must be:

        As we can see, the package hierarchy can be resolved with dot characters. The package declaration

    <boxed title="The default package">
        <![CDATA[
        We don't necessarily need to declare a package. If we don't, the <b>default package</b> will be used,
        however, this is discouraged.
        <p>
        Most importantly because the default package can't be referenced, and so we won't be able to import classes
        from it!
        <p>
        For very simple applications with only one package, it's <i>OK</i> to use the default package.

        If we wish to use code (a class) from another package, we must <b>import</b> it, without this
